# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Project overview
- Purpose: React-based web application using Kepler.gl for advanced geospatial data visualization
- Technology: React 19, Kepler.gl 3.2.0, React Map GL, Create React App
- Integration: Visualizes geological and mining data exported from the parent Mindat API scraper project
- Data format: Designed to consume GeoJSON and CSV data for interactive mapping and analysis

Architecture
- React application bootstrapped with Create React App
- Main components:
  - src/App.js: Main application component integrating Kepler.gl
  - src/index.js: Application entry point
  - public/: Static assets and HTML template
  - build/: Production build output directory

Key dependencies
- kepler.gl@3.2.0: Core mapping and visualization library
- react-map-gl@8.0.4: React wrapper for Mapbox GL JS
- react@19.1.1 & react-dom@19.1.1: React framework
- @testing-library/*: Testing utilities

Common commands
- Install dependencies:
```bash path=null start=null
npm install
```
- Start development server:
```bash path=null start=null
npm start
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```
- Build for production:
```bash path=null start=null
npm run build
```
- Run tests:
```bash path=null start=null
npm test
```
- Serve production build locally:
```bash path=null start=null
# After npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

Current implementation status
- Basic React app structure is set up with Kepler.gl dependencies installed
- App.js configured for full-screen Kepler.gl instance with OpenStreetMap base layer
- Uses CartoDB Positron style instead of Mapbox (no API token required)
- Ready to accept GeoJSON data from parent project exports

Known issues and TODOs
- App.js imports './kepler.gl' but should import from 'kepler.gl' npm package
- No data loading mechanism implemented yet
- Missing integration with parent project's GeoJSON exports
- No custom styling or branding applied

Data integration workflow
1. Export data from parent project using scripts/to_leaflet_geojson.py
2. Place GeoJSON files in public/ directory or implement dynamic loading
3. Configure Kepler.gl layers and filters for geological data visualization
4. Set up proper data schemas for mines, geomaterials, and locality information

Development workflow
- Use React development patterns and component architecture
- Leverage Kepler.gl's built-in UI for data analysis and visualization
- Customize map layers, filters, and interactions as needed
- Build production version for deployment to static hosting

Integration with parent project
- Consumes GeoJSON data generated by scripts in parent project
- Provides advanced visualization capabilities beyond the basic Leaflet implementation
- Suitable for complex data analysis workflows and interactive exploration
- Can handle large datasets with clustering and performance optimizations

Kepler.gl features available
- Multiple data layer support (points, polygons, arcs, etc.)
- Advanced filtering and aggregation
- Time-series animation capabilities
- 3D visualization and extrusion
- Custom color schemes and styling
- Export functionality for maps and data
